This game was made in Unity. To play the game, load the entirety of the assets folder and packages
into Unity. Then, open Scene1 and the game will be playable. Depending on your monitor size/if you
want to play with the game maximized/minimized, adjust the "Cam Distance" value under the camera
follow script that. You can adjust this by clicking on the main camera gameObject under the Scene1
heirarchy. Then, under the inspector the cam distance value can be adjusted.

To play the game, click the radioactive symbol on the right of the title scene. To access the
controls, click on the control panel below the radioactive symbol. There you will see you use WASD
or the arrow keeys to walk. Spacebar to jump. And to access the pause menu in game, hit escape. The
goal of the game is to collect as many of the soul fragments as you can, and to do so as fast as
you can because there is a cloud of radiation blowing in from the left. Also, avoid falling the the
radioactive pits.
